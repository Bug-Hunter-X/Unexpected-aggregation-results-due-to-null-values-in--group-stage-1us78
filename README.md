## MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the MongoDB aggregation framework:  incorrect handling of null or undefined values within the `$group` stage. The bug results in inaccurate summation and unexpected sorting of the aggregation results.  The solution showcases how to effectively handle these values using the `$ifNull` operator.

### Description
The original code attempts to perform a simple aggregation: matching documents, grouping by a field, summing values associated with that field, sorting by the sum, and limiting to the top 10 results. However, because of the presence of null or undefined values in the 'value' field, the `$sum` operator does not behave as expected, leading to incorrect aggregation results. 

### Solution
The solution uses the `$ifNull` operator within the `$group` stage to explicitly handle null or undefined values in the 'value' field, ensuring the `$sum` operator works correctly. The `$ifNull` operator replaces null or undefined values with 0, preventing errors and producing accurate aggregation results. This is crucial for correct analysis and reporting.
